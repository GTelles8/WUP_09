# Predicting Fish Weight

Find the best model using two variables to predict perch weight, and compare this to the best overall model.

## Perch

```{r}
Perch = filter(Fish, Species =='Perch')

```

```{r}
modelPerch = regsubsets(Weight ~ Length1 + Length2 + Length3 + Height + Width, data = Perch)
summary(modelPerch)
```
