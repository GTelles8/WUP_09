# Predicting Fish Weight

Find the best model using two variables to predict perch weight, and compare this to the best overall model.

## Perch

```{r}
Perch = filter(Fish, Species =='Perch')

```

### Best Models

```{r}
modelPerch = regsubsets(Weight ~ Length1 + Length2 + Length3 + Height + Width, data = Perch)
summary(modelPerch)
```

##The best two variable predictors for Perch weight is by using heigth and width data sets.

```{r}
best2Perch = lm(Weight ~ Height + Width, data = Perch)
summary(best2Perch)
```

### Best Two regressor model

Is Weight = -536 + 74.77*Height + 69.62*Width




## Pike


```{r}
Pike = filter(Fish, Species =='Pike')
```

### Best Models

```{r}
modelPike = regsubsets(Weight ~ Length1 + Length2 + Length3 + Height + Width, data = Pike)
summary(modelPike)
```

##The best 2 variable predictors are Length1 and Length3 data sets.


```{r}
best2Pike = lm(Weight ~ Length1+ Length3, data = Pike)
summary(best2Pike)
```

### Best Two regressor model
Is Weight = -1675.79 + -105.64*Length1 + 141.25*Length3


## Roach
